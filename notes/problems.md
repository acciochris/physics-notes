as well as concepts I haven't understood

Discuss the problems below [here](https://github.com/acciochris/physics-notes/discussions).

## Calculus

Calculus, James Stewart, 8th edition early transcendentals

### Section 3.3 (p197)

$$
41.\;\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\tan 6t}{\sin 2t}
$$

## Physics

### Section 1.2

- Exercise 10

### Section 1.5

- Example 7
- Example 8
- Exercise 43
- ```{admonition} Question?
  Instantaneous center of rotation vs center of rotation?
  
  Instantaneous velocity & acceleration?
  ```

### Section 2.1

- Example 5 (minimum value)

### Section 2.3

- ```{admonition} Question?
  The notes claim that when using multiple moment equations to determine a static equilibrium, one
  should be careful to choose two independent rotation axes, but how?
  ```
